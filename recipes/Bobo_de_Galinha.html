                <h1>Bobo de Galinha</h1>
                <p>This is one of our favorite recipes. Bobo de Galinha is a very popular dish made in Brazil but instead of chicken it is usually made with shrimp and served inside a hollowed pumpkin, it looks so delicious and fancy the only problem is that I donâ€™t eat seafood, it simply does not agree with me. I decided to try the recipe using chicken instead and just like that, we created Bobo de Galinha! This is a very tasty, creamy and gluten free dish that will please everyone.</p>
